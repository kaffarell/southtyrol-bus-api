## School
For a school project we created a little website for this api. Instead of making the requests to this app and then to the OpenData Endpoints, we created a slim, client-side version of this api. We embedded this library in a html page and created a small demo-application which displays the different bus-lines that stop at a specific bus-stop. 

Because we had to use different apis for this school project, we also included the meme of the day, fetched directly from the reddit api and the current teacher-of-the-week leaderboard, fetched from our api (can be found at kaffarell/teacher-of-the-week).

Website for the display also hosted here: https://southtyrol-bus-api.netlify.app/
